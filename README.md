### Phaser

I wanted to learn more about [Phaser](http://phaser.io) because I have always wanted to make a cool web browser game, other than the Ping Pong game we made in class. Phaser has a powerful AI that allows web developers to make web browser games in a simple manner. The physics and animation is what really stood out to me when making my 
[soccer game](http://students.washington.edu/csb206/info343/Corys-Toolbox/). There are not any special requirements needed in order to run the game. This game shows the value in Phaser because it shows many fundamentals needed in a Phaser game such as collisions, scoring and movement. 

For new users of Phaser, this is how to [get started.](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started) The documentation was also very good when using the [basic tutorials](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game) of the gaming engine. Here is a link for some [examples](http://phaser.io/examples) of people using Phaser as well. I thought it was alittle easier finding the syntax I needed specific to my game by using outside sources as well. 

I was able reference work from the community of Phaser because it is pretty active. The last commit in the Phaser [github](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) was October 19th and there are roughly 3,500 forked users. There are about 11,000 github users who have starred Phaser, but there remains about 119 issues to fix. A negative side to using Phaser was getting used to the classes/objects and understanding Phaser's state manager. But all in all, Phaser proved to me that it is a superior gaming framework for new users who want to make simple games!
